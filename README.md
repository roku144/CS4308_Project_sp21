# CS4308_SCL_Interpreter
## Interpreter for the SCL language, written in Python. 

### The project is broken down into 3 parts: the Scanner, the Parser, and the Interpreter. 

#### Scanner - 
* The Scanner reads the source file, line by line, and converts each useful word into a Token object.
* A Token holds the original word and a numerical code that represents the word's function within the language.
* The Scanner returns a "tokenized" line to the Parser.
#####Suggested changes:
* Improve reading of characters in Check()
* Removal of user input from the scanner and support the input of file/path by means of paramater passing
#### Parser - 0% complete.


#### Interpreter - 0% complete.
