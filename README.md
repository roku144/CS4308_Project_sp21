# CS4308_SCL_Interpreter
## Interpreter for the SCL language, written in Python. 

### The project is broken down into 3 parts: the Scanner, the Parser, and the Interpreter. 

#### Scanner - 
* The Scanner reads the source file, line by line, and converts each useful word into a Token object.
* A Token holds the original word and a numerical code that represents the word's function within the language.
* The tokens are sent into a file, temp.txt, where they await parsing.
* The Scanner returns a "tokenized" line to the Parser.

#### Parser -
*The Parser reads a file, temp.txt created from the scanner, and verifies the syntax.
*

#### Interpreter - 0% complete.
